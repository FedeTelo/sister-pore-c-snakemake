# basecalls.tsv - one entry per run/flowcell
# run_id: A unique id for this run, it's best to avoid special characters
# enzyme: The case-sensitive name of the enzyme used, must be in biopython's list
# refgenome_ids: A comma-separated list of refgenome_ids, must match those provided in the references.tsv file
# biospecimen: An id for the sample (required if using the haplotype-aware version of the pipeline).
# fastq_path: Path to a fastq file containing the reads for this run. If a relative path is given then it is relative to the snakemake workdir
